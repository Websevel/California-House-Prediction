🏡 **California Housing Price Prediction**

This project predicts median house prices in California using machine learning models. It is built with Python, utilizes scikit-learn for model training, and features an interactive Streamlit UI for user input and visualization. Developed in PyCharm IDE.
🔍 **Objective**

To build a regression model that accurately predicts housing prices based on features such as location, average income, population, and housing characteristics.
📊** Dataset**

    Source: California Housing Dataset from scikit-learn’s built-in datasets

    **Features:**

        MedInc: Median income in block group

        HouseAge: Median house age

        AveRooms: Average number of rooms
